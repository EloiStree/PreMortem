# Pre-Mortem
Welcome to you on this repository. 
I am death... 

I mean not really (o_O') but maybe... Who knows ?!

This repository is an simple self-discipline experiments:
- Consider everyday of a project like the last one you can spend on it.
- Consider every researh as the last day you can make report on it.
- Consider every tutorial as if you won't be there to explain it later.

_++"At the opposite of a post-mortem where you wait the project conclusion to report it,
I want to learn to make report all along the way, like it could be stop at anytime... 
Because 90% of the time it does"_
