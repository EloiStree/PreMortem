``` Code, games, applications... access my tools as if I were death today. ```

# Pre-Mortem
Welcome to you on this repository.

I am death... 
I mean not really (o_O') but maybe... Who knows ?!

This repository is an simple self-discipline experiment:
- Consider everyday of a project like the last one you will spend on it.
- Consider every researh as the last day you can/will report on it.
- Consider every tutorial as if you won't be there to explain it later.
- Consider every publication like the last update you will push.
- Consider that your harddrive could be formated at anythime.
- Remove yourself of a project because it is not about you.

**Consider every projects like you won't be there to keep them alive... because you often won't.**

_"At the opposite of a post-mortem where you waite the project conclusion to share, publish and explain it,
I want to learn to make it all along the way, like it could be stop at anytime... 
Because 90% of the time it does."_
